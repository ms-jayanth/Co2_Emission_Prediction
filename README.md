## Introduction:
Global warming is one of the biggest challenges currently being faced by the human race, although correlation is not causation a likely cause of global warming is due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide from human activities. 

Passenger cars produced approximately three billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide in 2020. The emissions produced by passenger cars have been steadily rising over the past two decades, increasing from 2.2 billion metric tons in 2000 to a peak of 3.2 million metric tons. Emissions fell roughly six percent in a 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused major disruptions to transportation.

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict CO2 emissions in g/km produced by any vehicle based on several car engine features.

## About Dataset:

### CONTENT
This dataset captures the details of how CO2 emissions by a vehicle can vary with the different features. The dataset has been taken from Canada Government official open data website. This is a compiled version. This contains data over a period of 7 years.<br>
There are total 7385 rows and 12 columns. There are few abbreviations that has been used to describe the features. I am listing them out here. The same can be found in the Data Description sheet.

Model
- 4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive
- AWD = All-wheel drive
- FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle
- SWB = Short wheelbase
- LWB = Long wheelbase
- EWB = Extended wheelbase

Transmission
- A = Automatic
- AM = Automated manual
- AS = Automatic with select shift
- AV = Continuously variable
- M = Manual
- 3 - 10 = Number of gears

Fuel type
- X = Regular gasoline
- Z = Premium gasoline
- D = Diesel
- E = Ethanol (E85)
- N = Natural gas

Fuel Consumption
City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per gallon (mpg)

CO2 Emissions
The tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometre) for combined city and highway driving
